# CraftMind
## A Framework For Quick AI Development
### OVERVEIW
- Craftmind is an attempt to create an AI framework that allows quick AI set up with very little modification needed. 
- With that in mind, it comes with functions that automatically build neural networks.
- Those functions include the ability to add layers, and specific number of neurons to each layer, and specific activation functions that can be modified at the layer level.
- If, however, such specification is not needed, simply inputing the number of layers and the activation function desired will be sufficient in creating the neural network.

### GETTING STARTED
- The examples used to demonstrate CraftMind are given in the layers test cases.
- Further documentation is being developed and will be available soon after version 1.0
