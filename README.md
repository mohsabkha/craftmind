# CraftMind
## A Framework For Quick AI Development
### OVERVEIW
- Craftmind is an attempt to create an AI framework that allows quick AI set up with very little modification needed. 
- With that in mind, it comes with functions that automatically build neural networks.
- Those functions include the ability to add layers, and specific number of neurons to each layer, and specific activation functions that can be modified at the layer level.
- If, however, such specification is not needed, simply inputing the number of layers and the activation function desired will be sufficient in creating the neural network.

### GETTING STARTED
- The examples used to demonstrate CraftMind will be three:
  - classification of images into certain classes.
  - classification of stocks into 2 classes; increasing by a certain threshold or decreasing by a certain threshold (in price).
  - prediciton of weather patterns over a certain/given geographic location
